# Gradient Boosting Classifier

# Introduction
Gradient Boosting Classifier is an ensemble machine learning algorithm used for classification by progressively enhancing model performance. It builds a set of weak decision trees and combines them to create a stronger predictive model.

# Key Features
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming data before model training.
2. Model Training: Implementing Gradient Boosting Classifier using scikit-learn.
3. Model Evaluation: Assessing performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

## Installation and Usage
